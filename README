Figment - a dynamically typed programming language with no defined semantics

Figment is a programming language unburdened with preconceived notions about
purpose and operational semantics. Its purpose is to be anything and everything
to anyone and everyone who uses it in any capacity. The core design principles
are:

1. Expressiveness - because programmers never write clever, indecipherable code
2. Terseness - because programmers never write clever, indecipherable code
3. Ergonomics over aesthetics - easier to write, harder to read
4. Customizability - every construct can be reinterpreted
5. Perl - Perl is awesome, so use (steal) features from it

I'm not even going to try to describe how to use this language.
