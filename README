Figment - a dynamically typed programming language with no defined semantics

Acknowledgements: This project makes liberal use of Chris Double's jsparse,
downloaded from github.com/doublec/jsparse.git. If you haven't checked it out,
you probably should. It's awesome.

Figment is a programming language unburdened with preconceived notions about
purpose and operational semantics. Its purpose is to be anything and everything
to anyone and everyone who uses it in any capacity. The core design principles
are:

1. Expressiveness - because programmers never write clever, indecipherable code
2. Terseness - because programmers never write clever, indecipherable code
3. Ergonomics over aesthetics - easier to write, harder to read
4. Customizability - every construct can be reinterpreted
5. Perl - Perl is awesome, so use (steal) features from it

The Figment -> JSON parser is maintained as a self-modifying Perl file [1]
called figment. You can run it like this:

$ ./figment parse examples/ops.fig      # Parse a file
$ ./figment parse "id::3 + 5"           # Parse the string '3 + 5'

It prints its output to stdout.
